# High-throughput sequence data handling course
I devloped and taught this course at [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/) in 2017. The course is designed for bio/life science researchers who need to know how to handle high-throughput DNA/RNA sequence data possibly generated from their own biological samples. The focus is on those topics of bioinformatics that are relevant to analysis of high-volume sequence data such as those generated by current sequencing technologies.

## Contents
There are 6 lecture slide decks in `lectures` and 5 lab exercise sets in `labs`. The topics include (with *sequence* meaning DNA sequence):
- Sequence assembly
- RNA-seq data analysis
- Marker gene metagenomics
- Whole genome metagenomics
- Sequencing read alignment
